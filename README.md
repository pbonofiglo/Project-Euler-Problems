# Project-Euler-Problems
This repository holds my solutions for Project Euler problems (see https://projecteuler.net/). These problems are, simply stated, mathematical/computational problems that cover a variety of mathematical and computer science topics. 

While many problems can often be solved with a few lines of code or a "brute force" algorithm, I try to put more thought and research into the problems and search for more elegant or efficient solutions. Therefore, my solutions may contain multiple methods.

The full problem statements and solutions are explained in detail in Jupyter notebooks using Python(.ipynb). Each problem has its own notebook. Some problems may have supplemental data/information to be used in the notebook. This data is stored in .txt files paired with the respective problem number.   

I do these problems in my spare time for fun and practice, so some problems may be missing based on my availability and interest.
